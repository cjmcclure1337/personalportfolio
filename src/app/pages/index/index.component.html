                      A web application for a fictional financial institution that tracks 
                      various investment opportunities such as stocks and foreign 
                      currency exchange (forex) with frequent updates and also other 
                      types of investments such as a menu of sample certificates of 
                      deposit (CDs). You can freely add money to your account and 
                      invest it in these options, watching how your return evolves 
                      in real-time. <br />

                      This project was done by a team of 6 people over the course of 
                      about 3 weeks. The Forex Marketplace API to update and display 
                      currency exchange rates and the Portfolio API to maintain all of 
                      a specific user’s investments in various assets were both solo 
                      projects by me developed as Express servers in Node.js using 
                      postgres to manage our data in SQL databases. On the front end, 
                      I implemented the components tied to those APIs and the full 
                      Buy/Sell functionalities for all assets. <br />
